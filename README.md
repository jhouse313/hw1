I'm sorry but I did not finish this homework or even come close to be honest. 
I got very discouraged after going to the lectures and not understanding much of them.
So, I was planning on dropping the class and was 90% sure about it. I thought about dropping CS entirely.
Because of this, I didn't do the homework because I figured it wouldn't matter since I was going to be dropping.
However, on Friday, I ultimately decided to stay in the class and continue to pursue my interests in computer science.
But, I was very busy the next few days and barely had time to work on it so I don't have much done. 
But, I'm determined to start the other assinments early and finish them on time.
Overall, I'm sorry for not having much of this done.
